# Tiny Chess

[![CI](https://github.com/dustywusty/tinychess/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dustywusty/tinychess/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A simple web-based chess game that you can play with just a link.

We give you a shareable URL and we'll randomly pick your side; the next person gets the other.

Anyone else who opens the link is a spectator.
