# Tiny Chess

A simple web-based chess game that you can play with just a link.

## Debug logging

Verbose logging can help during development. Run the server with the
`-debug` flag to enable additional log output:

```
go run . -debug
```

Or when using the compiled binary:

```
./bin/tinychess -debug
```
